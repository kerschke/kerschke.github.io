These pages contain a brief description [about me](about), my [research activities](research) -- including a list of publications, [<img src="https://cran.r-project.org/Rlogo.svg" width="25px">](https://cran.r-project.org/)-packages that I have been contributing to, as well as a selection of scientific events (conferences, workshops, hackathons, etc.), where I have actively been involved in the organization. And right below this text, you will also find something like a *news* tracker with recent activities.
