I just arrived in Heidelberg, where I will spend the next week as participant of the ["6th Heidelberg Laureate Forum"](https://www.heidelberg-laureate-forum.org/event_2018/).

In case you haven't heard of this event before: it is very unique in a way that it is starring a plethora of the best Mathematicians and Computer Scientists of the world. All of the laureates have won (at least) one of the most important awards in these two research fields such as the Fields Medal, the ACM Turing Award, or the Abel Prize. Given that there exists no Noble Prize for Mathematics or Computer Science, the aforementioned awards are usually considered to be its equivalent within these two research domains.

Considering that there will be more than 30 of these masterminds at the HLF, I am already very excited and anxiously looking forward to the inspiring input from luminaries such as Whitfield Diffie and Martin Hellman, John E. Hopcroft and Richard Manning Karp, Sanjeev Arora, Sir C. Antony R. Hoare and most recently, Peter Scholze. Of course, all of the invited laureates are impressive, yet I felt like giving a short teaser of the list of attendees.

And like meeting those geniuses wouldn't suffice, there will also be roughly 200 further international attendees (from undergrad students to PostDoc researchers), who also seem to have interesting academic backgrounds. Among them, you'll find researchers who are currently working at various prestigious institutions such as the following ones:

* Germany:
  * Hasso-Plattner-Institute
  * Max-Planck-Institute
  * TU Dortmund
  * TU and FU Berlin
  * University of Tübingen
  * TU Darmstadt
  * University of Heidelberg
  * RWTH Aachen
  * TU Munich
* Europe (except for Germany)
  * Oxford University (UK)
  * Cambridge University (UK)
  * University College London (UK)
  * University of Edinburgh (UK)
  * INRIA (France)
  * École polytechnique fédérale de Lausanne (Switzerland)
  * KU Leuven (Belgium)
  * TU Delft (Netherlands)
  * University of Trento (Italy)
  * Barcelona Supercomputing Center (Spain)
* USA:
  * Harvard University
  * Stanford University
  * Massachusetts Institute of Technology
  * Princeton University
  * UC Berkeley
  * IBM Research
* many, many more (sorry for not listing every single one of them, this list was just too impressive)
