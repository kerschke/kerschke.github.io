Thanks to an invitation by Pietro Olivieto, I recently participated in a COST Action meeting in Coimbra, Portugal.

By definition COST is a European network for cooperating in science and technology and I have to admit, the name fits pretty well. This particular COST action is entitled ["Improving Applicability of Nature-Inspired Optimisation by Joining Theory and Practice"](http://imappnio.dcs.aber.ac.uk/index.php) and as a result, I've spend the last two days in meetings on "closing the gap" between theory and practice.
