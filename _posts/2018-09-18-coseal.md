After COST and PPSN, the ["6th COSEAL Workshop"](http://www.coseal.net/coseal-workshop-2018/) led to my third consecutive business trip this month.

COSEAL itself is an international network of researchers, whose focus is on algorithm selection and algorithm configuration, and which was founded five years ago in MÃ¼nster, Germany. This time, the workshop was organized by our French colleagues and hence took place at INRIA in Paris, France.
