#### Welcome!

No matter for whatever reason you came across this website in the first place, feel free to stay here for a while and have a look.

#### What to expect from this place?

These pages contain a brief description about me (see below) and my research activities -- including a [list of publications](publications), R-packages that I have been contributing to, as well as a selection of [scientific events](events) (conferences, workshops, hackathons, etc.), where I have actively been involved in the organization.


#### Who am I?

I am a data scientist, who at the same time happens to work as a [postdoctoral researcher](http://erc.is/p/kerschke) in the group of *Information Systems and Statistics* at the University of Münster, Germany.
Previously, I have received academic degrees in *Data Analysis and Data Management (B.Sc.)* and *Data Science (M.Sc.)* -- both from the Statistics Department of the University of Dortmund, Germany -- as well as a PhD from the Department of Information Systems at the University of Münster, Germany.

Moreover, I consider myself an R-enthusiast. That is, I really enjoy to program, optimize, analyze and visualize almost anything with the statistical programming language R.


#### Data Science in a Nutshell

If you are now wondering what a *data scientist* actually is (and does), let me try to help you. *Data science* is a very interesting, important and recently emerging research topic, which first employs technologies from computer science to (pre-)process data in a meaningful way, and afterwards uses a mixture of computer science and statistical methods to extract and analyze the information contained within that data.


#### Research Topics

Of course, data science is of high importance and interest for several applications and unfortunately, I do not have the time to perform research in all of them. Instead, I decided to focus on a subset of topics that I found of particular interest:

- Automated Algorithm Selection
- Exploratory Landscape Analysis
- Machine Learning
- (Black-Box) Continuous Optimization
- Multi-Objective Optimization
- Discrete Optimization (mainly TSP)
- Evolutionary Computation
- Benchmarking
