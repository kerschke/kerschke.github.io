#### Welcome!

No matter the reason you came across this website in the first place, stay here for a while and have a look.

#### What to expect from this place?

These pages contain a brief description about me (see below) and my research activities -- including a [list of publications](publications), R packages that I have contributed to, and a selection of [scientific events](events) (conferences, workshops, hackathons, etc.) in whose organization I have been involved.


#### Who am I?

I am a data scientist working concurrently as a [postdoc](http://erc.is/p/kerschke) in the group for *Data Science: Statistics and Optimization* (formerly known as *Information Systems and Statistics*) at the University of Münster. Previously, I earned academic degrees in *Data Analysis and Data Management (B.Sc.)* and *Data Science (M.Sc.)* -- both at the Department of Statistics at TU Dortmund University -- and a PhD at the Department of Information Systems at the University of Münster.

Moreover, I consider myself an R-enthusiast. That is, I really enjoy to program, optimize, analyze and visualize almost anything with the statistical programming language R.


#### Data Science in a Nutshell

If you are now wondering what a *data scientist* actually is (and does), let me try to help you. *Data science* is a very interesting, important and recently emerging research topic, which combines technologies from computer science and statistics to (pre-)process data in a meaningful way, and afterwards extract and analyze the information contained within that data.


#### Research Topics

Of course, data science is of high importance and interest for several applications. However, unfortunately, I do not have the time to perform research in all of these fields, but instead decided to focus on a subset of topics that I currently find of particular interest (in alphabetical order). Those topics are basically on the intersection of optimization and machine learning:

##### Automated Algorithm Selection and Configuration

<ul>
  <li>Understanding and Characterization of Problems:</li>
  <ul>
  <li>Exploratory Landscape Analysis<br>
  (Characterization via Scalable Features)</li>
  <li>(Interactive) Problem Visualization</li>
  </ul>
  <li>Optimization Domains:</li>
  <ul>
  <li>Continuous (Black-Box) Optimization</li>
  <li>Discrete Optimization (mainly TSP)</li>
  </ul>
  <li>Performance Assessment and Benchmarking of Algorithms</li>
  <li>Feature Selection and Algorithm Configuration</li>
</ul>


##### Multi-Objective Continuous Optimization

<ul>
  <li>Visualization of Multi-Objective Landscapes</li>
  <li>Development of Landscape Features</li>
  <li>Landscape-Aware Algorithm Design</li>
  <li>Implications for Single-Objective Optimization<br>
  (Multi-Objectivization)</li>
  <li>Multi-Objective Performance Assessment</li>
</ul>


##### Further Topics of Interest and/or Perspective Research Avenues

<ul>
  <li>Automated Machine Learning</li>
  <li>Benchmarking</li>
  <li>(Large-Scale) Data Analytics</li>
  <li>Dynamic Algorithm Selection and/or Configuration</li>
  <li>Evolutionary Computation</li>
  <li>Interpretable Machine Learning / Explainable AI<br>
  (Trustworthiness of AI / ML Methods)</li>
</ul>
