        "excerpt":"Thanks to an invitation by Pietro Olivieto, I recently participated in a COST Action meeting in Coimbra, Portugal. By definition COST is a European network for cooperating in science and technology and I have to admit, the name fits pretty well. This particular COST action is entitled “Improving Applicability of Nature-Inspired Optimisation by Joining Theory and Practice” and as a result, I’ve spend the last two days in meetings on “closing the gap” between theory and practice.

        "excerpt":"Immediately after the COST action meeting finished, the 15th International Conference on Parallel Problem Solving from Nature started in Coimbra, Portugal. Especially the first two days were very intense for Mike and me, as we were involved in several workshops and tutorials. On the first day of the conference, Mike and I held a tutorial on “Exploratory Landscape Analysis”. Later during that day, I was giving a talk on “Analyzing the Impact of Performance Indicator Parameterizations on the Assessment of Algorithm Performances” in the BB-DOB workshop. On Sunday morning, Mike and I were supporting Marcus Gallagher in our joint workshop on “Investigating Optimization Problems from Machine Learning and Data Analysis”. And to conclude our marathon-weekend of talks and presentations, Mike was holding the “3rd International Workshop on Advances in Multimodal Optimization” on Sunday afternoon, in which I was invited to give a presentation on “Exploiting a Problem’s Multimodality for Improved Multi-Objective Optimization”. As said before, these aforementioned sessions were pretty intense. But of course, we managed to recover from these days rather quickly – although I might have given a different response on that, if someone would have asked me right in the morning, after hiking up the steep hill to the university building. Anyways, in retrospective we were more or less recharged when the conference officially started on Monday morning and thus were able to fully enjoy the entertaining keynote speech by Kurt Mehlhorn, as well as the set of very interesting posters – not only in the best paper session. The remainder of the conference, including a nice Welcome Reception in one of the buildings from the university’s campus, was also very pleasant. After the conference was officially finished, I participated in a guided tour of the ancient campus of Coimbra. In fact, its buildings are so impressive that UNESCO named it a World Heritage Site in 2013.  ","categories": ["news"],

        "excerpt":"After COST and PPSN, the “6th COSEAL Workshop” led to my third consecutive business trip this month. COSEAL itself is an international network of researchers, whose focus is on algorithm selection and algorithm configuration, and which was founded five years ago in Münster, Germany. This time, the workshop was organized by our French colleagues and hence took place at INRIA in Paris, France. ","categories": ["news"],

        "title": "6th Heidelberg Laureate Forum",
        "excerpt":"I just arrived in Heidelberg, where I will spend the next week as participant of the “6th Heidelberg Laureate Forum”. In case you haven’t heard of this event before: it is very unique in a way that it is starring a plethora of the best Mathematicians and Computer Scientists of the world. All of the laureates have won (at least) one of the most important awards in these two research fields such as the Fields Medal, the ACM Turing Award, or the Abel Prize. Given that there exists no Noble Prize for Mathematics or Computer Science, the aforementioned awards are usually considered to be its equivalent within these two research domains. Considering that there will be more than 30 of these masterminds at the HLF, I am already very excited and anxiously looking forward to the inspiring input from luminaries such as Whitfield Diffie and Martin Hellman, John E. Hopcroft and Richard Manning Karp, Sanjeev Arora, Sir C. Antony R. Hoare and most recently, Peter Scholze. Of course, all of the invited laureates are impressive, yet I felt like giving a short teaser of the list of attendees. And like meeting those geniuses wouldn’t suffice, there will also be roughly 200 further international attendees (from undergrad students to PostDoc researchers), who also seem to have interesting academic backgrounds. Among them, you’ll find researchers who are currently working at various prestigious institutions such as the following ones:   Germany:          Hasso-Plattner-Institute      Max-Planck-Institute      TU Dortmund      TU and FU Berlin      University of Tübingen      TU Darmstadt      University of Heidelberg      RWTH Aachen      TU Munich        Europe (except for Germany)          Oxford University (UK)      Cambridge University (UK)      University College London (UK)      University of Edinburgh (UK)      INRIA (France)      École polytechnique fédérale de Lausanne (Switzerland)      KU Leuven (Belgium)      TU Delft (Netherlands)      University of Trento (Italy)      Barcelona Supercomputing Center (Spain)        USA:          Harvard University      Stanford University      Massachusetts Institute of Technology      Princeton University      UC Berkeley      IBM Research        many, many more (sorry for not listing every single one of them, this list was just too impressive)     View at Heidelberg Castle (photo taken by Pascal Kerschke).","categories": ["news"],
